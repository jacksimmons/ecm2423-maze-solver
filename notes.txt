- get current node (vector2)
- pick a direction that isn't visited (doesn't matter preference)
- go all the way down that direction until a wall is hit (adding each visited node to the path, and to visited)
- if there is another direction at the wall that isn't back, try that
- repeat steps 3-4 until the goal is reached, or backtracking is required
- remove each backtracked node from the path, keep it in visited
- backtrack until a new direction is possible, then try that one
